# Security Implementation Plan

## Authentication & Authorization

### API Key Management
- **API Key Generation**
  - Cryptographically secure random keys (256-bit minimum)
  - UUID v4 or custom format with entropy validation
  - Key rotation mechanism with configurable expiration
  - Separate keys for different access levels (read-only, full access, admin)

- **Key Storage**
  - Hash API keys using bcrypt/scrypt (never store plaintext)
  - Salt each key individually
  - Store in secure database with encryption at rest
  - Environment variable configuration for master keys

- **Key Validation**
  - Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
  - Rate limit key validation attempts
  - Log failed authentication attempts with IP tracking
  - Automatic key suspension after repeated failures

### Access Control Levels
```
- Guest: Limited requests, basic voices only
- Basic: Standard rate limits, all free providers
- Premium: Higher limits, premium providers (ElevenLabs, etc.)
- Admin: Full access, configuration changes, analytics
```

## Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

### Multi-Layer Rate Limiting
- **Per-IP Rate Limiting**
  - Sliding window algorithm (Redis-backed)
  - Different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated
  - Exponential backoff for repeated violations
  - Configurable limits: requests/minute, requests/hour, requests/day

- **Per-API-Key Rate Limiting**
  - Account-based quotas independent of IP
  - Different limits per subscription tier
  - Token bucket algorithm for burst handling
  - Separate limits for different endpoints (/tts vs /providers)

- **Resource-Based Limiting**
  - Character count limits per request
  - Total audio generation time per period
  - Concurrent request limits per user
  - Queue depth limits to prevent memory exhaustion

### DDoS Protection
- **Request Validation**
  - Input sanitization and length limits
  - Content-Type validation
  - User-Agent filtering for bot detection
  - Referrer validation for web applications

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
  - Automatic service degradation under load
  - Fallback to cached responses
  - Provider-specific circuit breakers
  - Health check endpoints for load balancers

- **Infrastructure Protection**
  - Reverse proxy with rate limiting (nginx/Cloudflare)
  - Geographic blocking for suspicious regions
  - IP reputation scoring
  - CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious traffic

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Text Input Security
- **Content Filtering**
  - Maximum text length enforcement (configurable per tier)
  - Profanity filtering (optional, configurable)
  - Spam detection using pattern matching
  - PII detection and optional anonymization

- **Injection Prevention**
  - SSML injection protection
  - Command injection prevention for local TTS engines
  - Path traversal prevention in voice/provider parameters
  - Unicode normalization to prevent bypass attempts

- **Parameter Validation**
  - Strict allowlists for voice names and providers
  - Numeric parameter bounds checking
  - URL validation for callback endpoints
  - File extension validation for uploads

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**
  - TLS 1.3 minimum version
  - HSTS headers with long max-age
  - Certificate pinning for critical endpoints
  - Secure cipher suite configuration

- **CORS Configuration**
  - Strict origin allowlisting
  - Credential-aware CORS policies
  - Pre-flight request validation
  - Dynamic origin validation based on API key

### File System Security
- **Audio File Management**
  - Sandboxed audio directory with restricted permissions
  - Filename validation to prevent directory traversal
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary files
  - Separate directories per user/API key

- **Binary Security**
  - TTS binary path validation
  - Process isolation for external TTS engines
  - Resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for subprocesses
  - Secure temporary file handling

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- **Access Logging**
  - All API requests with timestamps, IPs, user agents
  - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
  - Rate limiting violations with context
  - Error conditions and exception details

- **Anomaly Detection**
  - Unusual request patterns (volume, timing, content)
  - Geographic anomalies for API key usage
  - Provider failure patterns
  - Resource consumption spikes

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Alert Triggers**
  - Rate limit violations above threshold
  - Authentication failure patterns
  - Error rate spikes per provider
  - Disk space/memory exhaustion

- **Metrics Collection**
  - Request latency and throughput
  - Provider success/failure rates
  - Cache hit/miss ratios
  - Resource utilization trends

## Data Protection

### Privacy Controls
- **Data Minimization**
  - No logging of TTS text content by default
  - Configurable retention policies
  - Automatic PII redaction in logs
  - Opt-in enhanced logging for debugging

- **Encryption**
  - Encryption at rest for sensitive data
  - Encrypted communication with cloud providers
  - Secure key derivation for file encryption
  - Forward secrecy for session data

### Compliance Features
- **GDPR Support**
  - Right to deletion endpoint
  - Data export functionality
  - Consent management
  - Processing purpose documentation

- **Audit Trail**
  - Immutable audit logs
  - Digital signatures for critical events
  - Retention policy enforcement
  - Compliance reporting endpoints
